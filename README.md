# Superego: Your Digital Freedom

Superego is an **open-source personal database** where you can store _anything_
you want about your life. Notes, tasks, meals, expenses, health logs... Whatever
you want—you define what goes in.

Your data is stored **locally**, in a SQLite file you own and that you can back
up and sync with Dropbox, Google Drive, or whichever service you already use.
**No accounts, no middlemen.**

On top of this, Superego gives you:

1. A **platform for building your own personal apps**.
2. An **AI assistant** to help you work with your data.

[Try the demo @ demo.superego.dev](https://demo.superego.dev).
