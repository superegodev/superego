# Superego: Your Digital Freedom

Superego is an **open-source _personal_ database** where you can store
_anything_ you want about your life.

Your data is stored **locally**, in files you can back up and sync with Dropbox,
Google Drive, or any service you already use. **No accounts, no middlemen.**

Superego is also:

1. An **app platform** for building (or vibe-coding) your own personal apps.
2. An **AI assistant** with a precise and detailed understanding of your data
   that can extract meaningful answers from it.

[Try the demo @ demo.superego.dev](https://demo.superego.dev).

## Why

**I'm tired** of apps that hold my data hostage and make me jump through hoops
to get it. Apps that drop features, enshittify, and go on incredible journeys.

I want **access to my data** and apps that **serve _me_**.

I also want **an AI assistant that actually knows me**, not one that slops out
bland, canned responses.
