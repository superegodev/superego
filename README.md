# Superego: Your Life's Database

Superego is a personal database app where you can store anything you want about
your life. Notes, tasks, meals, expenses, health logs... Whatever you want,
really; you define what goes in it.

Your data is stored locally, in a SQLite file you own and that you can backup
and sync with Dropbox, Google Drive, or whichever service you already use. No
accounts, no middlemen.

On top of this, Superego gives you two main functionalities:

1. An AI assistant that you can use to collect and explore your data.
2. A platform to build small personal applications that use that data.
