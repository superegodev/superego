# Superego: Your Life's Database

Superego is a general-purpose database for your life. Store notes, tasks, meals,
expenses, health logs... Whatever you want, really; you define what goes in it.

Your data is stored locally, in plain files you own and that you can backup and
sync with Dropbox, Google Drive, or whatever service you already use. No
accounts, no middlemen.
