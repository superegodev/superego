# Superego: Your Life's Database

Superego is a general-purpose database for your life. Store notes, tasks, meals,
expenses, health logs... Whatever you want, really; you define what goes in it.

Your data is stored locally, in a SQLite file you own and that you can backup
and sync with Dropbox, Google Drive, or whichever service you already use. No
accounts, no middlemen.
