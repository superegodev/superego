# Superego: Your Digital Freedom

Superego is an **open-source _personal_ database** where you can store
_anything_ you want about your life.

Your data is stored **locally**, in files you can back up and sync with Dropbox,
Google Drive, or any service you already use. **No accounts, no middlemen.**

Superego is also:

1. A **platform for** building your own personal **apps**.
2. An **AI assistant** for your data.

[Try the demo @ demo.superego.dev](https://demo.superego.dev).

## Why

**I've had it** with apps that hold my data hostage and make me jump through
hoops to get it. Apps that drop features, enshittify, and go on incredible
journeys. I'm bored by bland AIs giving me canned responses.

I want my data **at my fingertips**, apps that **do what I need**, and an AI
that **knows me**.
